Established in 2021 and inspired by a life-changing event, The Bardo Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to accelerating osteosarcoma treatment, finding a cure, and improving the lives of families affected by it.

Our goal is to make a real difference in the lives of those affected by osteosarcoma, and we invite you to join us in this mission.  Whether you're a medical professional, a concerned parent, or someone looking to make a difference, there is a role for you in the Bardo Foundation.
